package graph

// GraphType is an enumeration that defines the type of a graph.
// It specifies whether the graph is directed or undirected and whether it is weighted or unweighted.
type GraphType int

// Enumeration values for GraphType.
// These constants represent different types of graphs:
const (
	DIRECTED_UNWEIGHTED   GraphType = iota // A directed graph with unweighted edges.
	DIRECTED_WEIGHTED                      // A directed graph with weighted edges.
	UNDIRECTED_UNWEIGHTED                  // An undirected graph with unweighted edges.
	UNDIRECTED_WEIGHTED                    // An undirected graph with weighted edges.
)

// String converts a GraphType value to its string representation.
// This is useful for displaying the graph type in a human-readable format.
